Deliverable 2: Wall Street Written Analysis

##Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
	- The purpose of this analysis is to put our new found knowledge we acquired about VBA to help Steve create a workbook to analyze his stock market 
	data to help his parents. The code will help create and understand a yearly based analysis for 12 different tickers his parents are interested in, the 
	total daily volume for the years 2018 and 2017, return percentage and how long it takes to compile. Using this analysis his parents and Steve can observe
	how these tickers performed in the years 2017 - 2018 and whether or not to make future invest decisiosn on the tickets performance. 

##Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
	- After refracting the code and following along with the module, the new run time for year 2017 & 2018 was 0.1210938 compared to the intial code which took around 
	0.58 seconds. With less statements and more for loops, it makes iterating through a large data base much easier. 

##Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
	##What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?'
	- Some advantages are iterating and producing results much faster, some disadvantages might be that includes increasing complexity when it comes to the code
	might make things harder. 
	##How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
	- Makes the code run much faster, no need to repeat every single part of the coding script which makes our lives much easier. Some cons might be 
	figuring out ways to change things and might lead to runtime errors.
